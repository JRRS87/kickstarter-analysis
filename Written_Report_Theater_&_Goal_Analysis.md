# Written Analysis of the Results


## Overview of Project

This presentation have data focused and distribuited in 2 analysis
- Theater Outcomes by Launch Date
- Outcomes based on goals

The Theater Parent category with its results can be visualized per month, and the labels for the successful, 
failed and canceled campaigns, including their Grand Total.
A line with markers chart create a visual persperctive from the flow of data and will help us to better 
visualize positions.

### Purpose

In this presentation is demostrated the diferences from the fared campaigns in relation to their launch dates
and their funding goals

## Analysis and Challenges

- Theater Outcomes by Launch Date
It does have a Total of 869 successful campaigns, leveing the month of may with the mayority as 111 successful campaigns.
A Median of 44 failed campaigns
The Total of 37 canceled campaigns are below the 44 Median from the Failed, and a mode of 3 canceled campaigns.

- Outcomes based on goals
Is a range from less than a 1000, to more than 50000, divided in successful, failed and canceled campaigns, with their percentage.
a line Chart help to visualize percentages among the ranges.


It is a Challenge to increase the successful campaigns and lower the median from the failed campaigns


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
In the 12 months presented in the chart, we have a grand Total of 1369 campaings in the year, And it does have a 
Total of 869 successful campaigns, leveing the month of may with the mayority of 111 successful campaigns.

And a total of 828 canceled projects


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

The difficulties are encountered at its most in the month of January wich have the higest canceled campaigns with a total
of 7.


Since is a challenge to create successful campaigns trough the 12 months and increase them 



## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

First conclusion, May is the most productive month whitin campaigns, having a total of 111 successful, 52 failed and 3 canceled

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

That is only the theater category presented.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

I pivot table can be created to analysis outcomes based on goals with a box and wiskers chart.
